# _Prototypal Inheritance_

**Notes** : 
Never use ```obj1.__proto__ = obj2``` It's very inefficient and I've demonstrated it just for understanding. 
Notes don't contain the entire concept as it requires understanding of OOP in JavaScript which is beyond the scope.

But the second video can help you with that.
