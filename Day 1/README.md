### What is a callback? 
(We have detailed lecture for this, don't worry too much about it)

_Understanding JavaScript Callbacks_ - https://youtu.be/Nau-iEEgEoM


If you already know what they are you can skip these videos.

But I want you to know that *__setTimeOut__* is asynchronous and accepts a callback.

#### Exercise

Guess the output of the following and the reason why you recieve the output that you do?

```
console.log('1');
setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('2')
},0);

console.log('3');
```

Note : PFA the notes for this topic and try to read them twice (before and after watching the video)
