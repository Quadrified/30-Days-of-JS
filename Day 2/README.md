# _Execution Context_

Understanding execution context is going to enable us to understand most of the JavaScript advanced concepts.

Let me not sugar coat things, this is a hard start. You might not understand many things right away and a lot more will come in my notes on this, so hang in there.

You'll have to watch these videos over and over again.

My notes : Read these notes first (you might not understand)
Watch the following videos and read it again.

Watch this video till he talks about execution context (around first 19 mins, don't need to watch the entire video) . He also talks about hoisting, scope chains etc during this process, you can ignore those terms for now. These are our next topics covered in detail
He uses https://ui.dev/javascript-visualizer/ to visualise the execution context. To understand in the best possible way please use this website the way he's using in the video. (Highly recommended)
